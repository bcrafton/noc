should we use NoC simulator or something ?

our thing is so simple is the thing ...

=======

its not interleaved like this
should be 256 / 16 or 128 / 16 ... not 256 total
and lets group PCM + SRAM

=======

allocate
route 
place

=======

route before place
> decouple convolution/matmul and all operations in our graph
> input/output, remove unnecessary information from data structures.

sram allocation is required
> large networks capacity limited
> small networks bandwidth limited

sram loosely coupled from PCM
> layer 1 = 256b/cycle
> layer N = 32b/cycle

=======

consider NoC bandwidth
> crazier our placement, the more it will be stretched.

SRAM bandwidth should always be <= link bandwidth
> can SRAM bandwidth be split ? 64b to right, 64b to left ? 
> what would be the max grouping size for SRAM then ? 128b = 4 SRAMs ? 

how much bandwidth would be needed to supply 128 PCRAMs ?
> 128 SRAMs = 4096b / cycle
> which would be ridiculous

=======

so how do we proceed
we dont really know how to do SRAM for these designs
and dont think we are going to magically figure it out
so we need to step forward and iterate later

> perform proper allocation for PCM
> perform SRAM allocation based on PCM allocation
